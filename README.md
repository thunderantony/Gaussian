# Gaussian Elimination

## AIM:
To write a program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. First,we want to import numpy,then import sys,assume a variable.
2. For gaussian elimination method, we want to make 2nd and 3rd column zero.
3. For that we want to make a range accorting to our program output.
4. Then print the program with correct form then the output will display.

## Program:

## Result:
Thus the program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination is written and verified using python programming.
